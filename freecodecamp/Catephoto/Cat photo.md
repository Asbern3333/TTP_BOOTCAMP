It is time to add a new section. Add a second section element below the existing section element.
```html
<body>
  <main>
    <section>
    </section>
  </main>

  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
```
# Figure&&Figcaption
The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.

Nest the image you just added within a figure element.

`<figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption>`
```
<figure>
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">

The` strong` for text is of strong importance or urgent.
# Form
Now you will add a web `form` to collect information from users.

The `action` attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example,` <form action="/submit-url"></form>` tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path `/submit-url.`
# Input&form

`label` elements are used to help associate the text for an input 
 `<label><input type="radio"> cat</label>` clicking the word cat also selects the button.
# Id

# Value
  Add a `value` attribute to radio buttons. set the button's `value `attribute to the same value as its id attribute.
# fieldset&Legend
The `fieldset` element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form.
The `legend` element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element.

`for` attribute with the same value as the  `id`
# Checked

# Header
inside it there is `title`
# HTMl
Add the `lang` attribute with the value `en` to the opening html tag to specify that the language of the page is English.
# DOCTYPE html
All pages should begin with` <!DOCTYPE html>`. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.
# Meta
`<meta charset="UTF-8">`
Tell the browser to parse the markup into multiple languages by creating a `meta` element as a child of the head element. Set its `charset` attribute to `UTF-8`.
# Div
The `div` element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. Add a `div` element inside the body element and then move all the other elements inside the new `div`.

`/* comment here */`
# Article
Itâ€™s looking good. Time to start adding some menu items. Add an empty `article` element under the Coffee heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer.
`article` elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. Nest two `p` elements inside your `article` element. The first one's text should be `French Vanilla`, and the second's text` 3.00.`
```HTML
  <article>
 <p>French Vanilla</p>
 <p>3.00</p>
</article>
<article>
 <p>Caramel Macchiato</p>
<p>3.75</p>
 </article>
 <article>
  <p>Pumpkin Spice</p>
  <p>3.50</p>
</article>
 <article>
 <p>Hazelnut </p>
<p>4.00</p>
</article>
 <article>
 <p>Mocha</p>
 <p>4.50</p>
 </article>
```
